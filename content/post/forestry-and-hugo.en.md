I haven't written here for a long time, but it's worth refreshing this blog a bit. Today's post will be short, and in it, I intend to present the integration of Hugo with the Forestry.io platform.

# What is Forestry.io?

Simply put, Forestry.io is a visual editor for our website. Thanks to Forestry.io, it is possible to publish and edit pages using a web browser.

# Integration

The integration of Hugo with Forestry.io is simple. Just log in to [https://app.forestry.io/](https://app.forestry.io/ "Forestry.io") using our Github account and fill in the data requested by the site step by step. After integration, just log in, go to the posts tab, and add or edit them using the visual Markdown editor. And that's basically it for today.
