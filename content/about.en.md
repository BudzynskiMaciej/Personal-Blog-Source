# About

My name is Maciej Budzyński, I am a technology enthusiast and a graduate of 
computer science at the Catholic University of Lublin. I also graduated from 
a technical school in the field of computer science, and I hold a diploma as 
a computer technician (qualifications E12, E13, E14).

I currently work as a software engineer for 
[Ringier Axel Springer Tech](https://tech.ringieraxelspringer.com/). 
In this job, I use technologies such as Python, C, JavaScript, Docker, 
AWS, Salt, MySQL, and Couchbase. My responsibilities include maintaining and 
developing the [Onet Poczta](https://poczta.onet.pl/) product.

Previously, I worked as a contractor (Python developer) for a global leader 
in the field of pharmacy and diagnostics, directly for 
[Nexio Management](https://www.nexio.pl/) as a Python developer. On a daily 
basis, I dealt with many Python libraries and frameworks such as: 
FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, sphinx, pytest, poetry.

Before that, I worked for the [Central Information Technology Center](https://www.coi.gov.pl/) 
as a Junior Java Developer, developing the Central Vehicle and Driver Register, 
Passport Document Register, and State Registers Systems. In these projects, 
I used technologies such as: Java7, Java8, Java11, SOAP, GraphQL, Apache Kafka, 
Docker, unit tests with Spock (Groovy), integration tests in Spring, Maven, 
Gradle, Jenkins, SonarQube, JIRA, version control system GIT (using the 
GitFlow methodology).

I started my programming adventure in the 4th grade of technical school. 
At first, I dealt with Pascal and C++, which were also present in the early 
years of my studies. In addition, I also used Python and the Django framework. 
I also dabbled in GoLang (which resulted in this blog based on Hugo, powered 
by Go).
